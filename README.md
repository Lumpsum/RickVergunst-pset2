The app starts off in a screen with some explanation of how the app works and a button to start of creating a story.
When you press this button the app wil choose a random .txt file from the assets folder and will go to the next page.
Within this next page you will be prompted by a text and within the text field itself to fill in a certain type of word. 
The app will also tell you how much words you have left to fill in to complete the story. The moment you press the final send button
to send your last word the app will go the final page that contains the full story with your chosen words. Within this page you can also
press another button to start over with a randomly chosen story out of the assets folder.

This app supports both landscape and portrait orientation and will retain words that you have filled in when you change the orientation.
